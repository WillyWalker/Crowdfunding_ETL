# Crowdfunding_ETL

# here we have our code written in the ETL_mini_project 
this is where we cleaned and merged data to be prepared for SQL

# from here we created a dataframe that displays all of our tables created.  These tables were campaign, category, contacts, subcontacts. We made sure to specify our primary key
